# OpenRCT2/OpenGraphics

**OpenGraphics** is a project established to replace the base graphics of Rollercoaster Tycoon 2. The aim is to create a set of freely-useable graphics that can be used with [OpenRCT2](https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2), to decouple its reliance on the copyrighted material from the original game and allow anyone to play the game for free.

## Getting Started

We're in the process of setting up pipelines and deciding on the direction of OpenGraphics. If you have experience with art or tools development than consider checking out our discussions about establishing the rendering process:
https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenGraphics/issues/24

You can already start helping out by creating 3D models for scenery objects. If possible, try to use Blender 2.7. Check out [the spreadsheet](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ljVeYxp8ijj5z4VuSa6Xo1-_p3wACdQCRudkvkLGApc) to see what has already been made. Just mark an object as WIP, and add your name to the author field.

## Chat

You can get in touch with us via the OpenRCT2 Discord server. There is a dedicated OpenGraphics channel that can be used to discuss this sub-project.

## Progress

Replacing every single sprite from RCT2 is a huge project. There are hundreds of thousands of sprites that need to be replaced, and this project is only just starting. Several contributors have experimented with different approaches and we're currently discussing how we can combine our efforts to create an efficient and faitful pipeline.
