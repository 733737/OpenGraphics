# OpenRCT2/OpenGraphics

**OpenGraphics** is a project established to replace the base graphics of Rollercoaster Tycoon 2. The aim is to create a set of freely-useable graphics that can be used with [OpenRCT2](https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2). This will help OpenRCT2 to be more accessible, as well as make it easier to add new features and content to the game.

## Getting Started

For most object types the most accurate and quickest way to create sprites is using the [RCT Graphics Helper add-on for Blender 2.79](https://github.com/oli414/Blender-RCT-Graphics)

Blender Render last available in [Blender 2.79](https://www.blender.org/download/previous-versions/) is the most accurate render engine (for its time) that we have access to as an open source project.
You can use other software to create your models as well, as long as your main source file that you contribute to the project is a a Blender (.blend) file.

Scenery objects and stalls are currently the most accessible object type to create 3D models for. Check out [the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ljVeYxp8ijj5z4VuSa6Xo1-_p3wACdQCRudkvkLGApc/edit#gid=1082671812) to see what has already been made. Just mark an object as WIP, and add your name to the author field.

## Requirements

- Only use public domain textures.
- Refrain from using premade models.
- Do not copy real life products (including rides). Look at how other games parody real life for inspiration, Planet Coaster is a good example of what is accepted.
- Objects need to maintain the same size and features as the RCT2 variants.

## Chat

You can get in touch with us via the OpenRCT2 Discord server. There is a dedicated OpenGraphics channel that can be used to discuss this sub-project.

## Progress

Replacing every single sprite from RCT2 is a huge project. There are hundreds of thousands of sprites that need to be replaced, and this project is only just starting. Several contributors have experimented with different approaches and we're currently discussing how we can combine our efforts to create an efficient and faithful pipeline.
